# 🧪 Cypress E2E Tests for Simple React Shopping Cart

> Automated end-to-end tests for a simple ecommerce shopping cart application built with React and TypeScript.

This project contains Cypress E2E tests for a React-based shopping cart app originally created by [Jefferson Ribeiro](https://github.com/jeffersonRibeiro/react-shopping-cart).  
The tests cover core user interactions such as adding products to the cart, updating quantities, and checking responsive behavior.
